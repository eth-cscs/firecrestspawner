firecrestspawner has been written starting from the code of [batchspawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner/tree/main).
The main change is that the calls to workload scheduler's commands to start, poll and stop jupyter notebook server jobs, has been replaced by using PyFirecREST functions.
