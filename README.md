# FirecRESTSpawner

FirecRESTSpawner is a JupyterHub spawner to launch notebooks servers via [FirecREST](https://firecrest.readthedocs.io).

FirecRESTSpawner has been written using [batchspawner](https://github.com/jupyterhub/batchspawner) as starting point, replacing the calls to workload scheduler commands by [PyFirecREST](https://pyfirecrest.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html) functions.
