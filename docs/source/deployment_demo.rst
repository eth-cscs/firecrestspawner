FireCREST's Docker Compose demo
===============================

In the GitHub repository of FirecREST you can find a `tutorial <https://github.com/eth-cscs/firecrest/tree/master/examples/jupyterhub>`_ on how to deploy JupyterHub with FirecRESTSpawner to target a Slurm cluster running locally on Docker. This simple deployment serves as both a demostration of the use and setup of FirecRESTSpawner and a convenient platform for its development.
